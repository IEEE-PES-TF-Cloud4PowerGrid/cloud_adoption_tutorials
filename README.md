### The tutorials are oriented to power system related personas, including but not limited to power system engineer, enterprise architect, energy market analyst, data analyst, data scientist, ML engineer, business intelligence analyst, etc.

> **Disclaimer**: the tutorials don't aim to provide any general guidance or CSP-specific best practices to address the cyber security and regulatory compliance concerns for the power industry stakeholders. Instead, it is developed to demonstrate the cloud advantages and readiness for unleashing the unseen values from power system businesses. We are **NOT** suggesting the configurations, permissions and policies shown in the demo cases for your production deployment. For detailed guidance on how to adopt cloud securely and reliably, please refer to the cloud provider's documentation and work with your IT, Cyber Security and Enterprise Architecture teams. You can also read our paper [Practical Adoption of Cloud Computing in Power Systems- Drivers, Challenges, Guidance, and Real-world Use Cases][IEEE-paper] for reference.
