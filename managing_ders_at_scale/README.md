# Aggregating and Managing DERs at Scale through the Cloud

## Introduction
This tutorial demonstrates a ***simplistic case*** of aggregating Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and managing them at scale for wholesale electricity market bidding.

The solution meets the following requirements
* Connect to thousands of distributed energy resources (DERs)
* Collect device measurements such as power output and run time every 5 min (minimum req: 5 min, most RT energy markets settle every 5 min)
* Keep data for 5 yearÂ for auditing and forensic purpose
* Analyze data via structured queries on-demand and periodically
* Visualize data thru charts on dashboard
* Identify the time slots when the aggregated capacity >= 100 kW
* Keep the cost low
* Anomaly detection and automatic notification
* Back up data in a different geographic region

##  Installing and Configuring Prerequisites
Check [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to learn how to install Node.js and npm

Install the AWS CDK Toolkit globally using the following Node Package Manager command.
```ini
npm install -g aws-cdk
```
Run the following command to verify correct installation and print the version number of the AWS CDK.
```ini
cdk --version
```
Create a CDK project in your project folder
```ini
cdk init der-management --language=typescript
```

## Bootstrapping
Deploying stacks with the AWS CDK requires dedicated Amazon S3 buckets and other containers to be available to AWS CloudFormation during deployment. Creating these is called [bootstrapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html). To bootstrap, issue:
```ini
cdk bootstrap aws://${ACCOUNT-ID}/${AWS-REGION}
```

## Build CDK Project
To build the project, run the command below
```ini
cdk synth
```
To deploy the template that you synthesized with CDK synth on an AWS account. You need to install AWS CLI on the build machine and set up an AWS profile
```ini
cdk deploy
```

If you wish to remove the stack from your AWS account, then run the following command
```ini
cdk destroy
```
